#### Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
A javascript program is a list of programming statements.

#### Statements
Javascript statements are composed of Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly" inside an HTML element with id = "demo".
``document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";``

#### Semicolons
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement.
```
let a, b, c,;
a = 5;
b = 6;
c = a + b;
```
#### JavaScript white space
Javascript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
