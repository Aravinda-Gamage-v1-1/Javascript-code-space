### Syntax

#### JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values
* Fixed values
* Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.

#### JavaScript Literals
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
1. Numbers are written with or without decimals
2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes

#### JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

#### JavaScript Identifiers / Names
Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
